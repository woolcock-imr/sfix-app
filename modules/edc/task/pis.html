							You are invited to take part in a research study to develop an App for people with insomnia. In this study, we aim to develop an App to treat patients with insomnia by providing an individualised sleep intervention.  <br><br>
							You have been invited to participate in this study because you have insomnia or have poor sleep. This Participant Information Statement tells you about the research study. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part in the research. Please read this sheet carefully and ask questions about anything that you don't understand or want to know more about.<br><br>
							Participation in this research study is voluntary. So it's up to you whether you wish to take part or not. <br><br>
							By giving your consent to take part in this study you are telling us that you:<br><br>

							&#x2714;	Understand what you have read<br>
							&#x2714;	Agree to take part in the research study as outlined below<br>
							&#x2714;	Agree to the use of your personal information as described.<br><br>
							You can print a copy of this Participant Information Statement to keep.<br><br>

							<u>The study is being conducted at:</u><br>
							Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney (NSW)<br><br>
							<u>Principal Investigators:</u><br>
							Dr Christopher Gordon<br>
							Dr Christopher Miller<br>
							Professor Rafael Calvo<br>
							Ms Dorian Peters<br>
							Professor Nick Glozier<br>
							Dr Delwyn Bartlett<br>
							Ms Melissa Aji<br><br>

							This project is funded by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Alertness, Safety and Productivity. This is an Australian Government Initiative that brings together industry, government, and university sectors in a coordinated program. The major aim of the CRC is to reduce the burden of impaired alertness on the safety, productivity and health of Australians. The Alertness CRC will develop and deploy the next generation of shift scheduling and workplace design techniques; alertness assessment devices; individualised programs for better sleep health; and, a range of innovative strategies to reduce fatigue. <br><br>
							<b>'What are the aims of this study?'</b><br>
							The main aim of this study is to develop an App which will help patients with insomnia treat their condition through a personalised sleep consolidation program. Your input will be used to determine the design features of the App. <br><br>
							<b>'What does this study involve?'</b><br>
							If you decide to participate, you will first be asked to complete two short questionnaires assessing insomnia symptoms and poor sleep (5 minutes). If eligible, you will then be asked to complete an online survey. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes and consists of questions about your phone usage, preferences relating to sleep mobile application features and previous experiences with health mobile applications or websites.<br><br>
							 <b>'How much time will the study take?'</b><br>
							The study will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. <br><br>
							Who can take part in the study?<br>
							You can complete the survey if you have insomnia or poor sleep, and if you are over the age of 18. <br><br>
							 <b>'Is participation in this study voluntary?' Can I withdraw from the study once I've started?</b><br>
							Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not have to take part in it. Your decision whether to participate will not affect your current or future relationship with the researchers or anyone else at the University of Sydney or Woolcock Institute of Medical Research.
							Submitting your completed questionnaire is an indication of your consent to participate in the study. You can withdraw your responses any time before you have submitted the questionnaire. Once you have submitted it, your responses cannot be withdrawn because they are anonymous and therefore we will not be able to tell which one is yours. <br><br>
							<b>'Are there any side-effects and/or risks associated with this study?'</b><br>
							Aside from giving up your time, we do not expect that there will be any risks or costs associated with taking part in this study.<br><br>
							 <b>'Are there any benefits associated with being in the study?'</b><br>
							It is hoped that by taking part in this research, you will be providing valuable information regarding the impact of treatment on sleep for insomnia.
							We are offering participants who wish to voluntarily take part in a prize draw for 1 of 5 Westfield Gift Cards valued at $50.
							If you wish to take part in the prize draw, you will need to provide a mobile number following completion of the survey (on the last page). Your mobile number will then go into a draw with the other participants who completed the survey. When the survey completion time closes, a random draw of supplied mobiles will be undertaken by a researcher who is not involved in the study. The successful participant will be notified by a telephone call to the mobile number. Please note, participation in the prize draw is voluntary. <br><br>
							<b>'Will I be told the results of the study?'</b><br>
							You have a right to receive feedback about the overall results of this study. You can tell us that you wish to receive feedback by providing your contact details in the survey.  This feedback will be in the form of a summary of the project's findings. You will receive this feedback after the study is finished.<br><br>
							 <b>'Confidentiality and Disclosures of Information'</b><br>
							All information obtained during this study, personal data and research data will be kept confidential. Any information taken from these records will be coded with a study number and your initials. By providing consent, you are agreeing to these conditions and understand that any data published in scientific journals will not identify you.<br><br>
							<b>'Further Information'</b><br>
							After you have read this information, Dr Christopher Gordon will be available to discuss it with you further and answer any questions you may have. If you would like to know more at any stage during the study, please feel free to contact Dr Christopher Gordon, Senior Lecturer and Director of Post-Graduate Studies, Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, Telephone: +61 2 9351 0586 or email: christopher.gordon@sydney.edu.au   <br><br>
							 <b>'Ethics Approval and Complaints'</b><br>
							The Sydney Local Health District Research Ethics Committee has reviewed and approved this study in accordance with the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007) incorporating all updates. This Statement has been developed to protect the interests of people who agree to participate in human research studies.
